      To make Nepali Yomari, start by preparing the dough by mixing rice flour
      with warm water until it becomes a smooth, soft, and non-sticky dough,
      then let it rest for 10–15 minutes. For the filling, gently heat chaku
      until it melts, then mix in grated coconut, sesame seeds, a little ghee,
      and optionally some cardamom powder, and let it cool slightly while
      keeping it soft. Wet your hands, take a small portion of the dough, and
      shape it into a cone by pressing the center and thinning the walls evenly.
      Fill this cone with the warm chaku mixture and pinch the top to seal it
      completely. Place the shaped yomaris in a steamer and steam them for 10–15
      minutes until the rice dough turns shiny and fully cooked. Serve them warm
      while the outer shell is soft and the inside is sweet and gooey.
